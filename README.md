<h2>Desciption : </h2>

The first ECU called HMI responsible for interfacing with the user and the second ECU called control ECU which is responsible for the system operations and control. In the project I implemented the following drivers Keypad, LCD, DC Motor, UART, Timer, I2C and External EEPROM.
